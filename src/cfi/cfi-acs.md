## Task F. Performance and Limitations

![[FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf)](./img/cfi-acs/area-ii/cfi-acs-area-ii-task-f-performance-and-limitations.png){width=5in}

### 1. Use of Charts, Tables, and Data to Determine Performance

* See Section 5 of aircraft POH for performance information
* Key phases of flight, performance charts to consult, and how they impact decision making
  * Takeoff and climbout
    * Is there enough runway to safely takeoff?
    * Is climb performance sufficient to clear surrounding terrain?
  * Accelerate-stop / accelerate-go distances
    * What will happen if an engine failure is encountered at various points during takeoff and climbout?
  * Cruise and fuel burn
    * Ensure enough fuel is available to complete flight
    * Determine duration of flight to know which weather forecasts to reference
  * Landing
    * Is there enough runway to safely land?
* See Baron-specific section below for performance charts
* **All engine service ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will climb at a rate of 100 FPM in smooth air with AEI
* **All engine absolute ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will no longer climb at all with AEI
* **Single engine service ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will climb at a rate of 50 FPM in smooth air with OEI
* **Single engine absolute ceiling**
  * Maximum altitude at which the plane will no longer climb at all with OEI
* **Accelerate-stop distance**
  * Achieve maximum power prior to break release
  * Reach lift-off speed
  * Both throttles to idle
  * Come to a complete stop
  * [14 CFR &sect; 23.55 (2017)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2017-08-29/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-23/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR5ed09dfc2a6b782/section-23.55) for aircraft more than 6,000 lb
* **Accelerate-go distance**
  * Achieve maximum power prior to break release
  * Reach lift-off speed
  * One engine dies
  * Climb to a height of 50 feet
* Performance data in POH based on a new aircraft
* Performance data in POH is based on trained professional test pilot
* No requirements on runway length that are dependant on accelerate-stop or accelerate-go distances
* Use good ADM to determine personal minimums associated with runway use

#### Effects of Exceeding Aircraft Limitations

Understand how to determine aircraft weight and balance and performance limitations, and the importance of operating the aircraft within its limitations to remain safe and avoid damage to the aircraft.

* See Section 2 of aircraft POH for Limitations
* Placards (also in POH)
* Purpose: Mitigate risk of damage
* Generally CG affects stability and control
* Limitations include
  * Weight and balance
  * Airspeed
  * Powerplant
  * Maneuver
    * For example, spins may be approved
    * Also depends on loading and thus category (utility or normal)
  * Flight into known icing
  * Fuel
    * How much fuel can be carried
  * Oil
    * Type of oil
  * Flap
    * Airspeeds flaps can be used
  * Gear
    * Airspeeds when retractable gear can be used
  * Instrument
    * Excessive pitch attitutde can tumble attitude indicator

Aircraft are certificated for weight and balance for two principal reasons:

1. The effect of the weight on the aircraft's primary structure and its performance characteristics
2. The effect of the location of this weight on flight characteristics, particularly in stall and spin recovery and stability

![Effects of CG movement.](./img/effects_of_cg_movement.jpg){width=3.4in}

* CG too far forward
  * Longer takeoff distance
  * Higher stalling speed
  * Reduced elevator effectiveness
  * Increased stability
  * Reduced fuel economy and speed
  * Limit imposed by making sure enough elevator authority to hold the aircraft in normal glide with power off / aircraft's landing characteristics are suitable.
* CG too far rearward
  * Worse than too far forward
  * Unstable
  * Reduced elevator effectiveness
    * May not be able to recover from a spin
  * Limit imposed by stability (making sure aircraft has correct damping) / stall recovery

### 2. Factors Affecting Performance

#### a. Atmospheric Conditions

* Density Altitude
  * Pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure
  * Affected by pressure, temp, humidity (negligible, but may play a factor)
  * Affects T/O, landing, climb rate
* Wind

#### b. Pilot Technique

#### c. Airplane Configuration

#### d. Airport Environment

#### e. Loading and Weight and Balance

### 3. Weight and Balance Terms

* Including
  * Basic empty weight
  * Maximum gross weight
  * Arm
  * Moment
  * Reference datum
  * Center of gravity (CG) and CG limits
  * Useful load

#### Definitions

* **Standard empty weight**
  * Plane and all permanently installed operating equipment
  * Also includes hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, full engine oil
* **Basic empty weight**
  * Standard empty weight plus optional and special equipment that have been installed
* **Ramp weight**
  * Plane loaded for flight prior to engine start (also known as taxi weight)
* **Takeoff weight**
  * Ramp weight minus fuel burned during taxi and run-up
* **Landing weight**
  * Greatest weight that an aircraft is normally allowed to have at landing
* **Useful load**
  * Ramp weight or takeoff weight minus basic empty weight
  * Basically stuff the pilot can choose to put in the aircraft - how much fuel, passengers, luggage
* **Payload**
  * Weight of passengers and cargo only
* **Usable fuel**
  * Fuel available during flight

The equipment list for an aircraft is located with the weight and balance data.

#### Standard Weights

* Gasoline: 6 lb/US gal
* Jet A, Jet A-1: 6.8 lb/US gal
* Jet B: 6.5 lb/US gal
* Oil: 7.5 lb/US gal
* Water: 8.35 lb/US gal

#### Determination of Weight and Balance

* See Section 6 of aircraft POH for weight and balance information
* Need to use *actual* weight and balance info kept in the airplane
  * The W in S.P.A.R.(R).O.W is for weight and balance
* Weight and balance calculations are along the longitudinal direction
  * Weight won't vary too much along lateral axis, but can depending on passenger configuration and assymetric fuel burn
* See below for weight and balance for N3622A

### 1. Regulatory Requirements for Supplemental Oxygen

```{.include}
./src/includes/oxygen-requirements.md
```

### 2. Physiological Factors

#### Hypoxia

```{.include}
./src/includes/hypoxia.md
```

#### Using Oxygen

* Take oxygen gradually to build up in small doses - the sudden supply of pure oxygen following decompression can aggravate hypoxia.
* Prolonged oxygen use can be harmful to health.
* 100% aviation oxygen can create toxic symptoms if used for too long.
  * Symptoms: bronchial cough, fever, vomiting, nervousness, irregular heartbeat, lowered energy.

#### Nitrogen

* Decompression sickness-evolving and expanding gases in the body.
  * Trapped gas-expanding/contracting gas in cavities during altitude changes can result in abdominal pain, toothache, or pain in ears and sinuses if the pressure change isn't equalized.
  * Evolved gas-with a sufficient pressure drop, nitrogen forms bubbles which can have adverse effects on some body issues.
  * Scuba diving compounds this problem.
    * See more on scuba in aeromedical factors section

#### Vision

* ==Vision becomes impaired with lack of oxygen, especially at night==

### 3. Effects of Atmospheric Conditions on Performance

### 4. Factors to Consider when Determining Performance

* Basically follow everything in POH/AFM
* Takeoff/landing performance
  * Winds
  * Surface condition
  * Density altitude
  * Runway slope
* Cruise performance
  * Winds
  * Density altitude
  * Lean technique
* If there is anything *not* covered in POH/AFM, use good ADM and act conservatively
  * For example, flat spots on tires may decrease landing performance on a wet surface
* Pilot performance
  * For example, demonstrated crosswind doesn't mean it's smart for the pilot to do that
* Make sure to do in flight what you have planned for on ground
  * For example, if planned for given RPM for fuel burn calculations, not using that power setting in flight will change actual fuel burn versus planned
* From AFH page 13-32 -- Without specific guidance for zero sideslip, a bank of 2 degrees and one-third to one-half ball deflection on the slip/skid indicator toward the operative engine is suggested.
* Generally, weight negatively impacts performance
* Generally, a forward CG decreases performance and increases stability

### 5. OEI Aerodynamics

```{.include shift-heading-level-by=3}

### 6. Relationship Between VMC and Stall Speed with Altitude

* As the aircraft is slowing during a VMC demonstration, it is approaching one of two possible things happening
  * Stall
  * Loss of control
* See the figure below, $V_{\text{MC}}$ decreases with altitude, stall speed remains the same
  * When plotted against IAS

![Stall versus yaw versus altitude when OEI.

    * Engine fire during start
      * Refer to POH/AFM for proper procedures, the below bullets are general guidance, see image below
      * If engine fails to start, mixture idle cutoff, keep cranking, fuel selector off, battery and alternator off
      * If engine starts, run the throttle up to about 1800 RPM for 20 seconds and then shut down
  * There are many factors to consider when it comes to which engine to start first
    * Recall John King from King school multiengine course
    * Engine that starts more easily
    * Distance from battery
      * Start the engine closer to battery first
    * Better being able to hear the second engine start
      * Start the engine on pilot side second
    * Engine start relative to onboarding passengers
      * Start the engine further from onboarding passengers first
    * Engine which is most visible from pilot seat (left)
    * Alternate which engine is started first
* Hot engine might have vapor lock

### 1. Elements of Safe Taxi Operations

* **Proper brake check and correct use of brakes.**
  * Brake use should be minimal
  * When turning can use differential braking to aid turn
* **Compliance with airport/taxiway surface marking, signals, and ATC clearances or instructions.**
  * Know where to find taxi diagrams, have them, make sure they are *current*, use them, brief them
  * Review airport signs and markings
  * Listen and write down ATC clearances, draw them on taxi diagram if helpful
* **How to control direction and speed.**
  * Biggest difference compared to single engine is the ability to use differential throttling to aid in turning while taxiing
* **Flight control positioning for various wind conditions.**
  * ==Position flight controls to help prevent wind gusts from lifting the plane==
  * Bugging the wind direction on the heading indicator can help the pilot position the controls correctly

![[FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 2: Ground Operations](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/03_afh_ch2.pdf) Figure 2-15: Control position when taxiing.](./img/afh/afh-figure-2-15-control-position-taxiing.png){width=3in}

* **Procedures used to avoid other aircraft and hazards.**
* **Runway incursion avoidance procedures.**
    * See CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) section
* **Procedures for eliminating pilot distractions.**
    * ==Before engine start passengers should be briefed using the SAFETY acronym==
      * Y for "Yak" is to remind passengers of the need for a sterile cockpit during certain phases of flight and taxiing
    * ==The pilot should be fully prepared before taxiing== so they can be vigilent during taxiing and not attempt to do other things (e.g. setup FMS) until stopped
* **Use of taxi chart during taxi.**
    * Always have current taxi diagram, review it, brief taxi instructions
* **Airport, taxiway, and runway position situational awareness.**
    * Refer to CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) document form more information
    * Aviate, navigate, communicate applies to taxiing
    * When in doubt, stop the plane and call ATC for clarification
* **Additional taxiing operations concerns at a non-towered airport.**
    * No taxi clearances are given, so need to exercise vigilance
    * Be alert at untowered airports for aircraft that might not be communicating their position or intentions

### Common Errors Related to Landplane Taxiing

a. **Improper use of brakes.**
b. **Improper positioning of the flight controls for various wind conditions.**
c. **Hazards of taxiing too fast.**
    * Planes are designed to fly, and are not graceful ground vehicles
    * Faster taxi speed makes it more difficult to percieve and react to obstacles, aircraft and other hazards while taxiing
    * Better to taxi slowly and carefully than try to save a minute
d. **Hazards associated with failure to comply with airport/taxiway surface marking, signals, and ATC clearances or instructions.**
    * See CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) document
e. **Hazards of taxiing at non-towered airports.**

## Task F: Before Takeoff Check

![[FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf)](./img/cfi-acs/area-v/cfi-acs-area-v-task-f-before-takeoff-check.png){width=5in}

### 1. Purpose of Before Takeoff Checklist Items

a. **Positioning the airplane with consideration for other aircraft, surface conditions, and wind.**
    * Into the wind to provide better cooling
    * Clear of the taxiway hold position, and out of the way in runup area
b. **Division of attention inside and outside the cockpit.**
c. **Importance of following the checklist and responding to each checklist item.**
d. **Reasons for ensuring suitable engine temperatures and pressures for run-up and takeoff.**
e. **Method used to determine that airplane is in a safe operating condition.**
    * **Before-takeoff check**
      * The systematic POH/AFM procedure for checking the engine, controls, systems, instruments, and avionics prior to flight.
    * The preflight should have checked many but not all items that need to be checked before flight
    * Additional checks are performed during the taxi and runup
    * Vigilance should be maintained as soon as the engines are started for any indications that a problem might exist
      * Sound, instrument indication, vibration, etc. that is not normal
    * Rolling out from taxi a brake check is performed
    * While taxiing checking correct indications on attitude indicator, turn coordinator, slip-skid indicator, and compass
    * Runup checks other systems like autopilot, magnetos, vacuum system, and others
    * Magneto checks
      * Typically magnetos have the following order: Off - R - L - Both - Start
      * Checking the the R magneto first and then L is to help ensure "Both" is selected before takeoff.
      * Otherwise, if we check R second, it is easier to turn back *towards* both, but instead of getting two clicks only getting one and ending up on L.
      * Magneto check checks three things:
        1. Magneto grounding wires (p-leads) are still connected. If not connected, then there will be no drop in RPM when you select that magneto.
        2. The drop in RPM falls within the recommended limits as defined in the POH. This says the remaining mag can provide sufficient spark to keep our engine running, even if with less than full power.
        3. The differential drop between magnetos is within limits, which might clue us in to a mistimed or other mag issue we should check out before the flight.
f. **Importance of reviewing takeoff performance airspeeds, expected takeoff distances, and emergency procedures.**
    * Most of this should have been determined before getting in the plane
    * Brief takeoff and emergency procedures so they are clear and fresh before takeoff
g. **Method used for ensuring that the takeoff area or path is free of hazards.**
    * Visually check the runway and final
    * Additional checks of base and downwind are helpful especially at untowered airports
    * Be alert at untowered airports for aircraft that might not be communicating their position or intentions
h. **Method of avoiding runway incursions and ensures no conflict with traffic prior to taxiing into takeoff position.**
    * See CFI TSA (Technical Subject Area) document

<!--
### Common Errors Related to Before Takeoff Check

a. **Failure to properly use the appropriate checklist.**
b. **Improper positioning of the airplane.**
c. **Improper acceptance of marginal engine performance.**
d. **An improper check of flight controls.**
e. **Hazards of failure to review takeoff and emergency procedures.**
f. **Failure to avoid runway incursions and to ensure no conflict with traffic prior to taxiing into takeoff position.**

### 1. Purpose of and Procedures for Short-Field Takeoff and Max Performance Climb

* **Procedures before taxiing onto the runway or takeoff area to ensure runway incursion avoidance. Verify ATC clearance/no aircraft on final at non-towered airports before entering the runway, and ensure that you are on the correct takeoff runway positioning the airplane with consideration for other aircraft, surface conditions, and wind.**
* **Short-field takeoff procedures.**
  * Most important thing: know what abort plans are prior to takeoff
  * Loss of an engine doesn't guarantee climb performance, especially at high density altitudes
  * Know the climb performance of the aircraft being flown so the correct plans can be made

### 1. Elements of Short-Field Approach and Landing

a. **How to determine landing performance and limitations.**
b. **Configuration and trim.**
c. **Proper use of pitch and power to maintain desired approach angle.**
d. **Barriers and other hazards which should be considered.**
e. **Effect of wind.**
f. **Selection of touchdown and go-around points.**

    * AFH page 13-21 says flap retraction during the landing rollout is discouraged, however, unless there is a clear, operational need.
    * It should not be accomplished as routine with each landing.
    * Landing conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction on the landing rollout should be considered.
    * When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.
l. **Use of brakes (landplane).**
m. **Use of checklist.**
n. **After landing runway incursion procedures.**

### 2. Common Errors Related to Short-Field Approach and Landing

a. **Improper use of landing performance data and limitations.**
b. **Failure to establish approach and landing configuration at appropriate time or in proper sequence.**
c. **Failure to establish and maintain a stabilized approach.**
d. **Improper technique in use of power, wing flaps, and trim.**
e. **Inappropriate removal of hand from throttles.**
f. **Improper procedure during roundout and touchdown.**
g. **Poor directional control after touchdown.**

## Task A: Steep Turns (AMEL and AMES)

![[FAA-S-ACS-25 Flight Instructor for Airplane Category Airman Certification Standards](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/cfi_airplane_acs_25.pdf)](./img/cfi-acs/area-ix/cfi-acs-area-ix-task-a-steep-turns.png){width=4in}

### 1. Elements of Steep Turns

a. **Relationship of bank angle, load factor, and stalling speed.**
    * Recall: stall is a function of angle-of-attack, and a stall can happen at any airspeed
    * Dominant physics here are the same as those in single engine
    * Relationship between bank angle and load factor is not linear
      * It varies like $\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}$, which is what is plotted below
    * Note also how to calculate maneuvering speed at weight less than max gross
      * $V_{\text{A}}=V_{\text{A,max}}\sqrt{\frac{W_{\text{act}}}{W_{\text{max}}}}$
      * [Aviation Stackexchange: Why does maneuvering speed vary with weight?](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/18912/why-does-maneuvering-speed-vary-with-weight)

![Angle of bank changes load factor in level flight. [FAA-H-8083-25B Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak) [Chapter 5: Aerodynamics of Flight](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/07_phak_ch5.pdf) Figure 5-53](./img/phak/phak-figure-5-53-load-factor-vs-bank-angle.png){width=3in}

b. **Overbanking tendency.**
    * In a turn, the outside wing travels at a faster airspeed than the inside wing and, as a result, it develops more lift
    * This creates an overbanking tendency that needs to be controlled by the use of opposite aileron when the desired bank angle is reached

![Overbanking tendency. [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 3: Basic Flight Maneuvers](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/04_afh_ch3.pdf) Figure 3-15](./img/afh/afh-figure-3-15-overbanking.jpg){width=3.4in}

c. **Torque effect in right and left turns.**
    * Torque effect (for planes with props that rotate clockwise from pilot's view) will tend to roll the plane to the right
    * This asymmetry may be apparent during steep turns
    * However, it's likely that other asymmetries will be more dominant, such as the following for example
      * Sight picture
      * Even throttle application
d. **Selection of a suitable altitude.**
    * ==Start at an altitude that ensures a minimum of 3,000' AGL will be maintaned throughout the entire maneuver==
      * Don't have a great reference, closest is [Commercial Pilot - Airplane Airman Certification Standards (FAA-S-ACS-7A)](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/media/commercial_airplane_acs_change_1.pdf) that specifies minimum altitudes for other maneuvers
        * The minimum is typically 1,500 AGL for any maneuvers, and where there is a difference in the minimums for multiengine they are increased to 3,000' AGL
        * Thus a minimum of 3,000' AGL seems reasonable for steep turns
      * The Baron POH, as an example, only specifies minimum 5,000' AGL for $V_{\text{MC}}$ demo, but not for any other maneuvers
    * More altitude is always good
e. **Orientation, division of attention, and planning.**
    * Use a spot on the windshield, glarshield, or compass and keep that on the horizon
    * To correct altitude deviations can use a combination of bank and pitch changes
f. **Entry and rollout procedure.**
    * Perform CHAPS
    * Select a visual reference
    * Two 360&#176; turns in opposite directions at a 50&#176; bank angle
    * Add power on roll-in followed by nose-up trim
    * Start rollout 20 degrees before target heading
g. **Coordination of flight and power controls.**
h. **Altitude, bank, and power control during the turn.**
i. **Proper recovery to straight-and-level flight.**
    * During rollout return the nose-up trim that was added on the roll-in back to where it was
    * Reduce power back to where it was on entry
    * Perform cruise checklist

### 2. Common Errors Related to Steep Turns

a. **Improper pitch, bank, and power coordination during entry and rollout.**
b. **Uncoordinated use of flight controls.**
c. **Improper procedure in correcting altitude deviations.**
d. **Loss of orientation.**

Additional common errors are listed in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) [Chapter 10: Performance Maneuvers](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/11_afh_ch10.pdf) on page 10-3.

a. **Use of prescribed emergency procedure.**
b. **Prompt closing of throttles.**
    * From AFH page 13-17
    * Aggressive use of rudder, nose-wheel steering, and brakes may be required to keep the airplane on the runway, particularly if an engine failure is not immediately recognized and accompanied by prompt closure of both throttles.
    * However, the primary objective is not necessarily to stop the airplane in the shortest distance, but to maintain control of the airplane as it decelerates.
c. **How to maintain directional control.**
d. **Proper use of brakes (landplane).**

### 2. Common Errors Related to Engine Failure During Takeoff Before VMC

a. **Failure to follow prescribed emergency procedure.**

```{.include shift-heading-level-by=3}
./src/includes/single-engine-procedure.md
```

### 1. Elements of Engine Failure After Liftoff

a. **Use of prescribed emergency checklist to verify accomplishment of procedures for securing the inoperative engine.**
    * AFH page 13-33 -- Other than closing the cowl flap of the failed engine, none of these items, if left undone, adversely affect airplane climb performance.
    * While shutdown of a malfunctioning engine may prevent additional damage to the engine in certain circumstances, shutting down an engine that can still produce partial power may increase risk for an accident.
    * Although it is a natural desire among pilots to save an ailing engine with a precautionary shutdown, the engine should be left running if there is any doubt as to needing it for further safe flight.
b. **Proper adjustment of engine controls, reduction of drag, and identification and verification of the inoperative engine.**
c. **How to establish and maintain a pitch attitude that will result in the best engine inoperative airspeed, considering the height of obstructions.**
d. **How to establish and maintain a bank as required for best performance.**
e. **How to maintain directional control.**
f. **Methods to be used for determining reason for malfunction.**
g. **Monitoring and proper use of the operating engine.**

### 2. Common Errors Related to Engine Failure After Liftoff

a. **Failure to follow prescribed emergency checklist.**
b. **Failure to properly identify and verify the inoperative engine.**
c. **Failure to properly adjust engine controls and reduce drag.**
d. **Failure to maintain directional control.**
e. **Failure to establish and maintain a pitch attitude that will result in best engine inoperative airspeed, considering the height of obstructions.**
f. **Failure to establish and maintain proper bank for best performance.**

### 3. Demonstrate and Explain Engine Failure After Liftoff

* This will be done in the airplane during normal operation.
* AFH page 13-35 -- The FAA recommends that all in-flight simulated engine failures below 3,000 feet AGL, be introduced with a smooth reduction of the throttle.
* Simulation of inflight engine failures below $V_{\text{SSE}}$ introduces a very high and unnecessary training risk.
* Following a simulated engine failure, the instructor cares for the "failed" engine just as the learner cares for the operative engine.
* If zero thrust is set to simulate a feathered propeller, the cowl flap is normally closed and the mixture leaned.
* An occasional clearing of the engine is also desirable.
* If possible, avoid high power applications immediately following a prolonged cool-down at a zero-thrust power setting.

### 1. Elements of VMC Demonstration

a. **Causes of loss of directional control at airspeeds less than VMC, the factors affecting VMC, and the safe recovery procedures.**
b. **Establishment of airplane configuration, adjustment of power controls, and trim prior to the demonstration.**
    * AFH page 13-27 An actual demonstration of VMC may not be possible under certain conditions of density altitude, or with airplanes whose VMC is equal to or less than VS.
    * Under those circumstances, as a training technique, a demonstration of VMC may safely be conducted by artificially limiting rudder travel to simulate maximum available rudder. A speed well above VS (approximately 20 knots) is recommended when limiting rudder travel.
c. **Establishment of engine inoperative pitch attitude and airspeed.**
d. **Establishment of a bank attitude as required for best performance.**
e. **Entry procedure to demonstrate loss of directional control.**
f. **Indications that enable a pilot to recognize loss of directional control.**
    * AFH page 13-26 if there are any symptoms of an impending stall such as a stall warning light or horn, airframe or elevator buffet, or sudden loss of control effectiveness; the pilot should terminate the maneuver immediately by reducing the angle of attack as the throttle is retarded and return the airplane to the entry airspeed.
g. **Proper recovery procedure.**

From Baron POH page 10-49:

> Engine-out minimum control speed generally decreases with altitude, while the single engine stall speed remains approximately constant for normally aspirated engines. No such demonstration should be attempted when the altitude and temperature are such that the engine-out minimum control speed is known, or discovered to be, close to the stalling speed. Loss of directional or lateral control, just as a stall occurs, is potentially hazardous.

## Oral Review

### What do you need to do to become an MEI?

* Need 15 hours PIC in category and class to become instructor
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.183(j)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.183#p-61.183(j))
* Need 5 hours in make and model to teach in a multiengine plane
  * [14 CFR &sect;61.195(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/part-61/section-61.195#p-61.195(f))

### What is a runway incursion?

* ***==Any occurrence in the airport runway environment involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of required separation with an aircraft taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending to land.==***

### What is a hot spot?

* ==Hot spots are areas designed to **alert pilots to potential conflicts.**==
* ==It is a place with a **history or potential risk of collision or runway incursion**, and where heightened attention by pilots and drivers is necessary.==

### What is the critical engine?

* ***==The critical engine is the engine whose failure would most adversely affect the airplane's performance or handling qualities.==***

### How is the critical engine determined?

* ==***On the Baron it's the left engine***==
* ==Determining critical engine (**PAST**)==
  * ==**P** - **P-factor**==
    * **==Yaw==** - ==due to larger lever arm from center of thrust on the right engine compared to the left==
  * ==**A** - **Accelerated slipstream**==
    * **==Roll==** - ==accelerated slipstream is outboard of the right engine and inboard of the left engine, hence a longer moment arm on the right as compared to the left==
    * **==Pitch==** - ==accelerated slipstream from the left engine has more interaction with the horizontal stabilizer, meaning if the left engine fails there is a larger pitching moment change than if the right engine fails==
  * ==**S** - **Spiraling slipstream**==
    * **==Yaw==** - ==the spiraling slipstream from the left engine interacts more with the vertical stabilizer creating a yawing moment to the left, which is a restoring moment if the right engine is lost.==
  * ==**T** - **Torque**==
    * **==Roll==** - ==The aircraft tends to roll *towards the failed engine*. Hence, if left engine fails the torque effect, which tends to roll the plane to the left, worsens the rolling moment.==

### What will the aircraft tend to do when an engine fails?

* ==When an engine fails the aicraft will tend to==
  * ==Yaw - towards the inoperative engine==
  * ==Roll - towards the inoperative engine==
  * ==Pitch - down==

### What is minimum control speed?

* ==**Minimum control speed ($V_{\text{MC}}$)**==
  * ==Speed below which we cannot maintain directional control if the *critical engine* quits *suddenly*==
  * ==Denoted by a *red line* on airspeed indicator==

### How is minimum control speed determined?

* ==Determine $V_{\text{MC}}$ using **COMBATS**==
  * ==**C** - Critical engine failed and windmilling==
  * ==**O** - Operating engine at takeoff power==
  * ==**M** - Max gross weight==
  * ==**B** - Bank up to 5&#176; to raise the dead engine==
  * ==**A** - Aftmost CG==
  * ==**T** - Takeoff configuration==
    * ==Gear up==
    * ==Flaps up==
    * ==Out of ground effect==
  * ==**S** - Standard day==
    * 29.92 inHg, 15 &#176;C
  * ==**1** - 150 lb rudder force max==
* ***==Generally the various iterations of the regulations have been designed to determine $V_{\text{MC}}$ at or near a worst-case scenario.==***
* ***==Whatever the value published in the POH/AFM, in reality the actual value may differ.==***
* ***==The most important thing is to be aware of this and be cautious to avoid situations in which if an engine fails that control will be lost.==***

### Why is minimum control speed important?

* ==Minimum control speed is a value below which we should rarely, if ever, fly the plane, and if so only cautiously.==
* **==Flying above $V_{\text{MC}}$ ensures that should an engine unexpectedly fail, we will not lose control.==**
* ==The lower $V_{\text{MC}}$ is the more margin of safety we have.==

### What factors lower $V_{\text{MC}}$?

* ==These are all ***good*** things with respect to $V_{\text{MC}}$==
* *==Basically all have to do with reducing assymetrical moments caused by one operating engine==*
* **==Heavier weight==**
  * ==More inertia in the event of "sudden" loss of engine==
  * ==Larger component of gravity used to combat sideslip when banking up to 5&#176;==
* **==Forward CG==**
  * ==Longer moment arm between CG and rudder==
* **==Flaps and gear down==**
  * ==Keel effect==
* **==Reduce drag on inoperative engine side==**
  * ==Cowl flaps on inop engine closed==
  * ==Feather dead engine==
* **=="Raise the dead"==**
  * ==Reduces additional adverse yawing moments due to sideslip==
* **==Higher density altitude==**
  * ==Less power by the operative engine reduces asymmetric thrust==

### What are accelerate-stop and accelerate-go distances?

* **==Accelerate-stop distance==** - ==The distance required from starting takeoff, reaching $V_{\text{R}}$, and then come to a complete stop.==
* **==Accelerate-go distance==** - ==The distance required from starting takeoff, reaching $V_{\text{R}}$, experience an engine failure, and then climb to a 50' AGL.==

### Why are accelerate-stop and accelerate-go distances important?

* ==Knowing accelerate-stop and accelerate-go distances can help with decision making based on what options the aircraft's performance gives should an engine fail at rotation in a given circumstance.==
* ==In the E55 Baron (for example at 95 &#176;F, 2,000' pressure altitude, full fuel with 420 lb of occupants and baggage, no headwind) a reasonable accelerate-go distance is about 5,500 ft, and the OEI climb rate is just under 500 fpm.==
* ==Under the same conditions the accelerate-stop distance is about 3,500'.==

<!-- * In a twin, when an engine fails, thrust is reduced by 50% and performace is reduced 80-90%. -->

### What is the single engine service ceiling and why does it matter?

* The altitude at which the maximum rate of climb on a single engine is 50 ft/min.
* The single engine absolute ceiling is where on a single engine a climb is no longer possible.
* Consider when flight planning the potential of impacts of losing an engine when flying over mountainous terrain.
