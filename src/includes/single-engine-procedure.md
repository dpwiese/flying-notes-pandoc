# Single Engine Procedure

* Before figuring out which engine quit
  * Rudder as required to maintain directional control
  * Flow right to left on engine controls
    * Mixtures full forward
    * Props full forward
      * This is to increase power to use to continue flying but also to help identify the bad engine
    * Throttle full forward
  * Pitch for $V_{\text{YSE}}$
    * ==$V_{\text{YSE}}$ is blue line on airspeed indicator==
  * Gear up
  * Flaps up
* **Identify**
  * Now identify the dead engine
  * "Dead foot dead engine"
  * "Stepping on the good engine"
* **Verify**
  * Retard throttle of suspected dead engine
    * If it is dead engine won't hear a change in sound or experience change in yaw
* **Feather**
  * Feather the prop on dead engine by pulling prop lever all the way back
* **Raise the dead**
  * Bank 5&#176; to raise the dead engine
  * This is to induce a slip to counteract the opposite slip that results from flying with a single engine and reduce drag
  * The horizontal component of lift offsets yaw caused by single engine
  * The ball will move towards the good engine
* **Close cowl flaps**
  * On dead engine
* Notes
  * Both aileron and rudder will be turned into the good engine
* The Twin Comanche procedure at AVAD called for the following items after gear and flaps up, before moving on to identify, verify, and feather:
  * Pumps on
  * Mags on
  * Fuel selector on mains
  * Verify fuel on gauge
* The Baron checklist and a lot of other resources online omit these steps from this part of the flow and put them at the end when determining whether to restart or secure the engine. This seems a bit odd given they are simple and quick to accomplish, and likely could solve the issue of a dead engine, especially given the FAA guidance in [FAA-H-8083-3C Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook) below:

  > Many cases of power loss are related to fuel starvation, where restoration of power may be made with the selection of another tank. An orderly inventory of gauges and switches may reveal the problem. Carburetor heat or alternate air can be selected. The affected engine may run smoothly on just one magneto or at a lower power setting. Altering the mixture may help. If fuel vapor formation is suspected, fuel boost pump operation may be used to eliminate flow and pressure fluctuations.

* Lastly, these memory items as part of the flow are also consistent with the flow in a single engine failure scenario, where the fuel selector would be set to both, or the fullest tank, fuel pump would be turned on, and mags would be checked, making it feel all the more odd that these checks would not be part of the engine failure in flight on a multi-engine plane until quite a bit later.

# Engine Failure Scenarios

* **General considerations**
  * Decide which steps of the single engine procedure to apply
  * Shut down an engine when it is producing more drag than thrust
    * To determine, retard throttle and listen for change in sound and change in yaw
  * Secure an engine so that lever positions match engine condition to avoid confusion
* **Engine failure after takeoff with runway remaining**
  * Throttles idle
  * Land and stop
* **Engine failure after takeoff without runway remaining**
  * Rudder as required to maintain directional control
  * $V_{\text{YSE}}$
  * Single engine procedure
* **Engine failure at altitude**
  * Depending on altitude, may not want to put mixtures full forward
  * Don't feather dead engine right away
    * Troubleshoot first
* **Engine failure during approach**
  * Don't put gear and flaps down until landing is assured
  * Gear down first
  * Flaps down last
  * Maintain $V_{\text{YSE}}$ until the runway is made and landing is assured
  * Fly slightly above $V_{\text{MC}}$ red line
  * Don't do a go-around after descending below pattern altitude
