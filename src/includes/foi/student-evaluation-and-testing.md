1. Assessment
    a. Purpose of assessment
    b. General characteristics of effective assessment
    c. **Traditional assessment**
        * Involves written testing (e.g., multiple choice, matching) and grading
        * Pretest
            * Criterion-referenced test constructed to measure the knowledge and skills necessary to begin the course
    d. **Authentic assessment**
        * Focuses on the learning process
        * Enhances the development of real-world skills
        * Encourages higher order thinking skills (HOTS)
        * Teaches learners to assess their own work and performance
    e. **Oral assessment**
        * Most practical means of evaluation
        * Reveals effectiveness of instructor's training
        * Questions should be brief / concise but suitably difficult to challenge learner
        * Questions can be
            * Fact - memory / recall
            * Thought - requires thinking
        * Oral quizzing
            * Identifies which points need more emphasis
        * Oral assessment
            * Direct (when, where)
            * Indirect (why, how of objective)
    f. Characteristics of effective questions
        * Written tests
            * Characteristics (**RVUCD**)
                * **Reliability**
                    * Yields consistent results
                * **Validity**
                    * Measures what it is supposed to measure
                * **Usability**
                    * Easy to give and grade
                * **Comprehensiveness**
                    * Effectively measures the overall objectives
                    * Liberally samples what is being measured and gives good measurement on overall objectives
                * **Discrimination**
                    * Measures small differences between learners distinguishes between learners with high and low achievment
                    * Includes all levels of difficulty
                    * Measures knowledge of the same topic in many different ways
            * Types
                * Supply
                    * Fill in the blank
                    * Learner has to organize
                    * Disadvantage - cannot be graded with uniformity
                * Selection
                    * True false, multiple choice, matching
                    * Highly objective, very easy to grade
                    * Easier to compare learners performance
                    * Easily adapted to statistical analysis
            * Designing test
                * Avoid absolutes like always, never
                * Answers should be about the same length on multiple choice test
                * Create attractive distractors (wrong answers) on multiple choice test
        * Performance tests
            * Checkride, for example
            * Desirable to evaluate training that involves procedure, operation, or process
            * **Criterion referenced**
                * Practical tests are an example - they are to the ACS and not a curve or anything else
            * **Norm referenced**
                * System of testing in which learners are ranked against the performance of other learners.
    g. Types of questions to avoid
2. Critique
    a. Instructors/student critique
        * An effective critique should be
            * Objective
            * Flexible
            * Acceptable
            * Comprehensive
            * Constructive
            * Well organized
            * Thoughtful
            * Specific
        * Critique should be delivered immediately after learners performance so they can remember the details
        * Assessment / critique not part of grading
        * Critique should be objective, constructive, thoughtful
            * Focus on strengthening areas of weakness
        * Critique should be flexible enough to the occasion and learner
        * For learner to accept critique they first need to accept the instructor
        * Methods
            * Instructor critique
            * Learner led critique
            * Self critique
            * Instructor/learner critique
        * Critique
            * Constructive
            * Clear
            * Consistent
            * Admit your own errors
    b. Student-lead critique
    c. Small group critique
    d. Individual student critique by another student
    e. Self-critique
    f. Written critique
