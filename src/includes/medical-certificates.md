# Medical Deficiencies

* [14 CFR &sect;61.53 Prohibition on operations during medical deficiency](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.53)
  * If you have a medical certificate and are taking medication or have a condition which would make you no longer meet the requirements *then you cannot fly*
  * Don't fly if you are unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner
* Certain medical conditions are disqualifying
  * [FAA What medical conditions does the FAA consider disqualifying?](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/faq/response6)
* Certain medical conditions will result in being issued a medical certificate with a limitation on it
  * For example if an applicant fails to meet the color vision standard as interpreted above but is otherwise qualified, the Examiner must issue a medical certificate bearing the limitation
    * Not valid for night flying or by color signal control
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Application Process for Medical Certification](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/general/si/)
  * [Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners Aerospace Medical Dispositions Item 52. Color Vision](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/)
  * Another example of a limitation is for someone who is hearing impaired they would require the limitation "not valid for flight requiring the use of radio."
  * Some disabilities may require special equipment to be installed in the aircraft, such as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia.
* **Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA)**
  * A statement authorizing medical certification of, at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, applicants whose disqualifying condition is static or non-progressive.
  * May be issued Letter of Evidence (LOE) that needs to be carried along with medical
  * May involve different levels of tests (e.g. Operational Color Vision Test (OCVT), Medical Flight Test (MFT))
* If you have any concern about potential medical deficiency, good idea to get medical certificate in the early stages of flight training
  * Remember, medical (and student pilot) certificate is required to solo
  * No age limit to log dual received, so potentially could be paying for and receiving a lot of flight training before even being eligible to solo, only to later find out you can't get medical (or it has limitation)
    * [14 CFR &sect;61.51(h) - Logging training time](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.51#p-61.51(h))

<!--
When all the knowledge, experience, and proficiency requirements have been met and a student can demonstrate the ability to operate the aircraft with the normal level of safety, a "statement of demonstrated ability" (SODA) can be issued.

This waiver, or SODA, is valid as long as the physical impairment does not worsen.

Contact the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) for more information on this subject.
