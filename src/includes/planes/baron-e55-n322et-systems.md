  * ==**C** - Continental IO-520-C==
    * Fuel injected
    * Six-cylinder
    * Rated at 285 horsepower at 2700 rpm

* **Propeller system**
  * ==3-bladed==
    * Hartzell
    * P/N: PHC-C3YF-2UF
    * 76 inch diameter
  * ==Variable pitch==
  * ==Constant speed==
  * ==Full-feathering==
  * Forces moving prop to feather (high pitch)
    * ==Springs==
    * ==Counterweights==
    * ==Air charge==
      * The air charge is not explicitly mentioned in the POH, but is in the prop guide for the propeller
  * ==Engine oil under governor-boosted pressure moves the blades to low pitch==
  * ==Has unfeathering accumulators==
    * Gas-assisted pressure to drive oil back into the propeller dome to get the propeller on a stopped engine (that isn't producing oil pressure) out of feather
    * Unfeathering accumulator like a balloon, when oil pump is going its blowing up the balloon
    * Feather is pinching the balloon closed
  * In prop big spring with nitrogen charge inside to push oil out
  * Counterweights on prop to drive prop to feather
  * POH page 7-20

## Environmental

![E55 Baron (N322ET) environmental schematic](../../../img/e55-baron-poh-n322et/e55-baron-poh-page-7-32-environmental-schematic.png){width=4.2in}

* Air Conditioner
  * Controlled by Sofie dial
    * Off
    * Fan
    * Gnd
    * Med
    * High
  * If you just want fan only need one alternator
  * To turn on AC need both alternators on
  * To get AC on ground need at 1000 RPM on both engines to supply enough power
  * If it overheats it will shut itself off automatically
  * Intake for AC condensor under fuselage
* There is vent on left rear fuselage to let air out of cabin
* Heater
  * Cabin heat controls temperature
  * Cabin air controls amount of airflow
    * Reducing cabin airflow allows for warmer air, but reduction below half turns off the heater
    * Pilot air controls airflow to the back seats via vents below the front seats
  * Blower only works on the ground

* Heated fuel vent?
* We have ice lights

## Oxygen System

* No oxygen system

<!--
* Accelerate-stop distance on a hot day at fairly high pressure altitude, maximum weight, and no headwind should be less than 5,000 ft.
  * It is possible that it is more than this, but 5,000 ft. is a conservative value to use as an upper bound in most "normal" circumstances
* Being as over conservative in determination of a bounding accelerate-go distance results in an inability to climb at all
  * Therefore need to be a bit less conservative
  * The POH example for accelerate-stop distance resulted in a value of 4,000 ft.
  * The POH example for accelerate-go distance is the same as that for accelerate-stop, but 450 lb lighter and this resulted in an accelerate-go distance (clearing 50 ft. obstacle) of 8,100 ft.
  * For our training scenarious out of KADS (95 &#176;F, 2,000' pressure altitude, full fuel with 420 lb of occupants and baggage, no headwind) a more reasonable accelerate-go distance is about 5,500 ft.
  * In this scenario, the OEI climb rate would be just under 500 fpm
